# Project Car Neural Net

Very versatile neural net based on the the original data processing assignment.

## to do:
    
### Make neural net for...

- body-style and dimension of the car affects the rate in which cars lose their value. **(already implemented)**
- engine specs(size, fuel-sys, num-of-cylinders, engine-type) and gas milage of that car
- Make, Num-of-doors,body-style V. symboling and normalized-losses
    
### extra thingies (when you have time):
- Engine-location w/ Drive-wheels and curb-weight Vs gas milage
- Engine-location w/ Drive-wheel and curb-weight V symboling (insurance probability risk)
- Engine type V. MPG
- engine specs(all) and car price

*Use the first neural net definition to make the others!*
