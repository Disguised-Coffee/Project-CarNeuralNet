# Project Car Neural Net

Very versatile neural net based on the the original assignment.

## Relationships to find:

- body-style and dimension of the car affects the rate in which cars lose their value.
- engine specs(size, fuel-sys, num-of-cylinders, engine-type) and gas milage of that car
- Engine-location w/ Drive-wheels and curb-weight Vs gas milage
- Engine-location w/ Drive-wheel and curb-weight V symboling (insurance probability risk)
- Engine type V. MPG
- Make, Num-of-doors,body-style V. symboling and normalized-losses
